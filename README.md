# facial-expression-recognition-tensorflow-keras
This code is using FER2013 dataset with keras library and tensorflow backend. This code was fork and modified for keras with tensorflow backend from https://github.com/LamUong/FacialExpressionRecognition

To run this code:
1. Download FER2013 Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data
2. Run python datapreprocessing.py to convert dataset to numpy format
3. Run python cnnmodel.py for trainning
